There are four types of statuses displayed for environments:

- **Running**: Indicates that that deployment is in progress.

- **Deployed**: This status means that the deployment was successful.

- **Failed**: It is displayed in the event of a failure.

- **Shutdown**: Environments that are no longer running are indicated with this status.

By clicking on Expand Deployment History, you can gain access to view all the deployments made previously.
